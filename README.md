The following C program generates the Fibonacci series up to a specified limit.

Features:
    Generates Fibonacci numbers efficiently using iterative approach.
    Allows the user to specify the limit up to which Fibonacci numbers are generated.

Usage:
    
    Compilation:
        Use a C compiler to compile the program.
        Example command: gcc fibonacci.c -o fibonacci
    
    Execution:
        Run the compiled program with the desired limit.
        Example command: ./fibonacci 10
        This will generate Fibonacci numbers up to 10.

    Input:
        The program takes a single command-line argument, which is the limit for generating Fibonacci numbers.

Documentation:

    For detailed documentation, refer to the comments in the source code (fibonacci.c). The code is well-commented to explain each step of the Fibonacci generation process.
